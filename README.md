# 🏛️ 3D Reconstruction of Lost Hampi Monuments  
_Rebuilding the past with the power of AI_

---

## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on **reconstructing the lost architectural marvels of Hampi** in stunning 3D. By combining cutting-edge AI techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), generative models, and 3D point cloud generation, we aim to **digitally revive historical heritage** that no longer exists in its physical form.

## 🛠️ Project Workflow  

### 🔍 1. RAG Implementation  
Extract rich contextual data about lost Hampi monuments from various online sources using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**. The data is stored efficiently using **ChromaDB** for easy querying and access.

### ✍️ 2. Prompt Engineering  
Using the collected information, we generate **question-answer pairs** related to lost Hampi architecture. These prompts help enrich our dataset and guide image generation with **precise architectural context**.

### 🖼️ 3. Text-to-Image Generation  
Descriptions and existing Hampi datasets are fed into a **text-to-image generation model** to create **high-resolution 2D visualizations** of the lost structures.

### 🧱 4. 2D to 3D Conversion  
The generated 2D images are transformed into **3D point cloud data**, bringing these historical wonders to life in immersive, digital 3D formats.
